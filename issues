Current issues that arise during modifications, my personal responsibility (ShaiW)
 - The label list in the AssemblyTranslator doesn't seem to update after I open it
 - Find a normal picture for the label list
 - The CPUEmulator doesn't actually do anything currently

Known quirks and bugs
 - The VMEmulator doesn't let you manually modify RAM once the "next step" or "full run" button is pushed
 - Pushing a constant kills the VMEmulator
 - The Java implementation of the keyboard class has poor keyboard sensitivity for some reason, 
   which does not happen when using our Jack class.
 - Sometimes the VMEmulator just stops responding to events, needs more research

Suggestions for further development
 - School supplied XML writer (DONE)
 - Store comments and labels in the CPUEmulator (under development by ShaiW)
 - Resize
 - Step-back button
 - Support for sound?
